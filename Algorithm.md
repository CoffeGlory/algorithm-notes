Entry points:
    1. All sort of data structures are mutants of Array and Linked List
    2. All sort of algorithms are some kinds of enumeration (brute force).
    3. Focus on what the loops are doing instead of reading words to words.

Java Basics:
    Fields declared a reference with default value that waiting for initialization.

Making Note:
    loop invariant: What is unchange in each iteration before anything execute.
    
Array Patterns:
    Binary search:
        Use for O(logN) search, speed first.

    Two pointers (fast & slow)
        Switch index at O(1) by retrieving one time.

    Two pointers (left & right):
        Another Switch index at ????? ##TODO

    Sliding window:
        What is it?
        Fixed-sized window
        Variable-size window
        Use:

    Prefix Sum Array:
        What is it?
        Precompute cumulative sums:

    Difference Array:
        What is it?

Linked List Pattern:
