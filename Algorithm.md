Entry points:
    1. All sort of data structures are mutants of Array and Linked List
    2. All sort of algorithms are some kinds of enumeration (brute force).

Array Patterns:
    Binary search:
        Use for O(logN) search, speed first.

    Two pointers (fast & slow)
        Switch index at O(1) by retrieving one time.

    Two pointers (left & right):
        Another Switch index at ????? ##TODO

    Sliding window:
        What is it?
        Fixed-sized window
        Variable-size window
        Use:

    Prefix Sum Array:
        What is it?
        Precompute cumulative sums:

    Difference Array:
        What is it?

Linked List Pattern:
